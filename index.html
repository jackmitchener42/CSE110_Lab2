            <h1>Jack Mitchener User Page</h1>
            <p>I am a <em>Math-Computer Science</em> student. I currently am waiting to hear back from law schools that I applied
                to back in October. So far I have heard back from UCLA and was admitted! I am very excited about this
                and am hoping to hear back more good news in the next couple months. 
                <br>
                My goal is to become an
                intellectual property or patent lawyer in the future. I want to develop a strong background in Computer
                Science so I can be the <span style="color:burlywood">best</span> lawyer possible for Software Engineers and other developers when they are
                trying to protect their products.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>An important aspect for my career is learning how to code. Even a basic understanding is helpful, such as knowing what <code>cout</code> does.</code></p>
