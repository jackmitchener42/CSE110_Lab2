		<p id="MyFuturePlans">My goal is to become an Intellectual Property Patent Lawyer. I have worked diligently throughout my life to get to the place I am now. My coursework has prepared me to engage in high level conversations with engineers regarding their inventions which will help the patent process because they will not have to dumb down their technology as much. I will be able to understand why their invention is different from other technology that exists at the time so we can secure a patent. In addition to my coursework I have begun the law school application process. I have taken the LSAT and earned a 170 which places me in the 97th percentile of test takers. I also have decided which law schools I intend on applying to, including UCLA.</p>
